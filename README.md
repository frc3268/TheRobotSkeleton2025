# REEFSCAPE2025

*repo for the robot code for Reefscape2025, created by FRC team 3268 with ValhallaLib*

**Features** swerve-drive code, camera code, autonomous code & dashboard code    
**More** features to come, including but not limited to: more dashboard code, more odometry integrations, and documentation

*This library tries to abide by the following "ideals":*

**Naming:**
- Subsystems: End with "Subsystem"
- Commands: End with "Command"
- Constants: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
- Methods/Functions: startWithLowerCaseThenCamelCase
- Classes: CamelCase

**Structure:**
- Lib: All the library (ie non wpilib) things go here
- Robot: everything else goes here

**Generally:**
- Keep it simple
- Don't appeal to boilerplate if you don't have to
- Allow extensibility

**Usage:**
1. Clone/fork the repo
2. Change constants to match your robot
3. Enjoy


**Thanks** to frc team 6814 for creating an excellent series on frc programming(0 to Autonomous). Their code in episode 6 served as the basis for much of the swerve-drive code in this library
